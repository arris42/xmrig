> Monero has completed its network hard-fork (July 2022). This change is for _solo_ miners that affected by Monero hard-fork, and not PoW. So regular _pool_ mining is not affected. See [v6.18.0](https://github.com/arris42/xmrig/releases/tag/v6.18.0) release

Consider making a donation to the [developer](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig#donations)
